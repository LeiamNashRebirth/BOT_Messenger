I started creating BOT way back 2021 my first project i made 
is from the scratch and yeah im just a noob back then
<Br> <br> When im starting to creating the method of API and SERVER it's always stop at console
and then i give up on that project
<Br> <br> Fast forward to `January 2022` i finnish the JavaScript and NodeJS project
but the BOT project remain unleft 
<Br> <br> I just installed the discord back then cause im super lonely at my life like it's so sick man but when im on discord
there's a lot of BOT operating every server so that's give me a little energy to start programing bots
<br> <br> I started to create a Discord BOT back then but i realize to back on my previous project BOT on messenger
<br> and i fail again so i just stop doing some program
<Br> <br> But on `April 2022` i wake up like i want to make some coding programs yeah my brain just told me that like it's so crazy man
and i do it again and finally it's work little bit only little but that's not give me a chill so i decided to improve my knowledge about technology and on <br>
`June 3,2022` i finally made it all of program is now working and there's only little bug on some commands and yeah i took me a `one year` to create this program
